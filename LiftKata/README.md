Lift Kata

- There will be a lift, floors, person and a lift control
- MVP will be 1 lift
MVP will be floors 0-10 (Changed this to 0-5 to begin with)
- MVP will be 1 person who starts on floor 0 and randomly picks a number between 1-10 (not including 0 cos why lift?)
- MVP is when person inputs floor number, lift will arrive at floor 0 and print “doors open”
- MVP is when lift prints “doors open”, Person enters lift (don’t know how this will be shown?) and when person is in lift, print “doors closing”
- MVP is lift then goes through each floor (printing as a timer?) until reaches desired floor
- When on desired floor, lift prints “doors open” and person exits or inputs “yes” to exit to floor

What questions do I initially have about creating/ designing the program?

- What the lift does and lift controller, how are the methods divided up? Or is lift just a presence and lift controller does most
- How to show the presence of a person (if statement?) how does it randomly happen? Realistically it would always be a person on floor 0 to begin but for the sake of the program should this be random?
- Presence of person on floor and in the lift
- How to show random input of desired floor number
- Once the lift has arrived, can transport person to another floor with control and user input? (so use lift – yes/no)(what floor? User input 1-10) and that input makes the lift move to that floor? (When person sets floor to go to, lift prints floors it is going through as a timer?)
- Lifts normally go all the way up and then back down to pick up people and drop off, so should there be a switch or iteration for asc/desc? Once it reaches 10, it goes back down to 0 and back up again.

Additional Thoughts
- What am I doing with objects, what's going on, what's happening, who is what
- Could potentially use Java Swing for click on action for lift floors/ call button
