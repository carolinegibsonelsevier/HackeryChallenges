Methods/ Steps of actual game
1. Create an array of strings with a word index to select from**
2. Use Java random to randomly select one of the words**
3. Use Scanner to get user input? and instantiate? (Look at Udemy)**
4. (Optional) At some point use a validator? To check the length of the input.
5. After A4/ Take scanner input and change it to uppercase (part of validation?)**
6. Take both scanner input and random string from word index array, compares both as arrays? For each loop?
[S,W,I,N,G]
[S,H,A,K,E]
[0,1,2,3,4]
7. 3 options -- 1.** If letter is correct letter and position, print letter to terminal with green background ANSII -- 2. If letter is correct letter but not position, print letter to terminal with yellow background -- 3.** If letter is just wrong, print it normally
